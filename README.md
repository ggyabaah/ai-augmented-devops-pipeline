# AI-Augmented DevOps Pipeline

This project implements an AI-enhanced CI/CD pipeline that brings intelligent automation into DevOps practices. By integrating machine learning models into traditional DevOps tools, this system aims to bridge the gap between Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD), enabling smarter, faster, and more reliable software releases.

## ✨ Features
- ML-based test case prioritisation using Scikit-learn
- Anomaly detection during deployments via unsupervised learning
- Real-time monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana
- Containerised application delivery via Docker and Kubernetes
- CI/CD orchestration through Jenkins and GitHub Actions

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- Jenkins
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- Prometheus & Grafana
- GitHub Actions

## 📊 Goals
- Reduce change failure rate and MTTR
- Automate decision-making in CI/CD pipelines
- Validate performance with real-world DevOps metrics

## 🧪 Status
Currently in development. Early prototype phase with basic model integration and metric collection in place.

## 📁 Structure
- `/pipeline/` – Jenkinsfiles, GitHub Actions workflows  
- `/ml-models/` – Scripts for training/testing ML models  
- `/monitoring/` – Prometheus and Grafana configs  
- `/docs/` – Diagrams and architecture documentation
